# **Java Multithreading Study Reference**

## **Introduction to Multithreading**

- **Definition**: Multithreading is a programming concept that allows a single process to have multiple threads of execution.
- **Benefits**: It can improve application performance by utilizing multiple CPU cores and allows for concurrent execution of tasks.

## **Creating Threads in Java**

- **Extending Thread Class**: **`java public class MyThread extends Thread { public void run() { // thread logic goes here } }`**
- **Implementing Runnable Interface**: **`java public class MyRunnable implements Runnable { public void run() { // thread logic goes here } }`**

## **Starting Threads**

- **Using Thread Class**: **`java MyThread thread = new MyThread(); thread.start();`**
- **Using Runnable Interface**: **`java MyRunnable runnable = new MyRunnable(); Thread thread = new Thread(runnable); thread.start();`**

## **Synchronization**

- **Definition**: Synchronization is used to control access to shared resources by multiple threads.
- **Keyword**: **`synchronized`** keyword can be used with methods or blocks to achieve synchronization.

## **Thread Pools**

- **Definition**: A thread pool is a group of pre-initialized reusable threads that can be used to execute tasks.
- **Benefits**: It reduces the overhead of creating new threads for each task and manages the execution of tasks efficiently.

## **Executors Framework**

- **Executor Interfaces**: **`Executor`**, **`ExecutorService`**, **`ScheduledExecutorService`** are interfaces provided by the Executors framework for managing thread execution.

## **Concurrent Collections**

- **Definition**: Concurrent collections are thread-safe versions of standard collections like **`ArrayList`**, **`HashMap`**, etc.
- **Benefits**: They provide thread-safe operations without the need for external synchronization.

## **Java Memory Model**

- **Definition**: The Java Memory Model (JMM) defines how threads interact through memory.
- **Key Concepts**: **`volatile`** keyword, happens-before relationship, and memory consistency effects.

## **Best Practices**

- **Avoiding Deadlocks**: Always acquire locks in the same order to prevent deadlocks.
- **Using ThreadLocal**: Use **`ThreadLocal`** when each thread needs its own instance of an object.

## **Conclusion**

- Multithreading in Java is a powerful feature that allows developers to write efficient and concurrent applications.
- Understanding the basics of multithreading and its related concepts is essential for writing robust and scalable Java applications.
